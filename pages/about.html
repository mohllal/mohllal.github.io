<div>
  <p>Software engineer trying to make the world a little better than the one I have known, one line of code at a time.</p>
  
  <p>My focus areas include backend engineering, distributed systems, databases, and cloud-native architectures.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not writing code or blog posts, you'll find me playing video games, watching documentaries, or spending quality time outdoors.</p>
  
  <p>I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the most effective ways to learn. Writing for me isn't just about explaining what I know, it's about exploring what I'm still learning.</p>
