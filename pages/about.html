<div>
  <p>A software engineer who finds joy in building systems that quietly serve millions, making life a little easier for people.</p>
  <p>I care deeply about scalability, reliability, and the simplicity of well-optimized infrastructure, finding each problem I solve to be an opportunity to learn, grow, and make a meaningful contribution in my own small way.</p>
